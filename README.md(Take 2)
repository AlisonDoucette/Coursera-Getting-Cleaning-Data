# Coursera-Getting-Cleaning-Data
After completing Take 1 of the Project I realized that there could be a different interpretation of Step #5:
"From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."
"Each" could also be interpreted as one row for each Activity/Subject Combination rather than for each actiity and for each subject.
Take 2 of the script takes this interpretation. 
This is perfect example of how when working with Data a specific description of the format of the requested output is imperative.
If the requestor of the data is not available, provide examples of both possible interpretations.
