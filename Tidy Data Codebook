Data Descriptions:
The Output.Data1 file contains calculated means data for the smart phone dataset referenced above(262 KB)
* The first column in the dataset is for the Activity, the second column is for the Subject tested.
* Subjects are numbered from 1 to 30. The age bracket for these subjects was 19-48 years.
* Activities are alphanumeric: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
* The variables(65 remaining columns) are for the means of the mean and standard deviations (in Hz) for sensor data (for the x,y,z axes where applicable).
* There is 1 row for the means for each Activity/Subject combination.

* There is 1 row for the means for each Subject/Activity combination.

Notes on variables: (from original dataset descriptions)
* The variables come from the an accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
* These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
* These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
* Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
* Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
* Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
* Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
